We have been quite busy with moving it to the new build system first as the document got too large for our old tooling. This is a great incentive as well to think of how we can make the guide more focused so that the size does not matter ;-) More news on the new release will follow soon... April 10th 2020: #StayHome and share your knowledge! \u00b6 Hi everybody, we are all in more or less restrictive lock-down situations, but the guideline is always #StayHome. This is definitely a challenging time for you, but also us. But luckily it was also never easier to collaborate and share, through so many different tools and platforms. The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) project team wants to encourage people to #StayHome and also use this time to share your knowledge with the community. So if you want to either share your knowledge in mobile security or are just keen in doing some research in this area, we have many open issues where we are still looking for volunteers. If you can close 5 issues that we marked with the tag #StayHome we will sent you in return a hard copy of the OWASP MSTG ! We are giving away a total of 5 books on a first come first serve basis. If you are interested, do the following: Go through the open issues in our Github repo with the tag #StayHome . Make a comment on the issue that you would like to take care of, which will be assigned on a first come first serve basis. For any clarifications you can ping either Carlos or Sven in OWASP Slack. If you don't have an account yet, please check here on how to register. Work on the issue and create a Pull Request (PR). If you are new to Git(hub), check out our contribution guide for further details. We will review the PR and merge once all comments are addressed/resolved. Start at 1. :-) We would love to have you as a contributor. Feel free to share the mail or like our tweet Stay safe, take care and #StayHome! Sven, Jeroen and Carlos March 17th, 2020: International release of MASVS 1.2 \u00b6 A new version of the OWASP Mobile Application Security Standard (MASVS) was released! The MASVS establishes baseline security requirements for mobile apps and summarizes them in one standard. With this new release we achieved a significant alignment and coverage with existing mobile security documents from ENISA, older NIST documents, OWASP Mobile top 10, and others. The new version 1.2 is available in Github Releases: https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/tag/v1.2 . For more details please look into our Changelog for Version 1.2 and Version 1.2-RC https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/blob/master/Document/CHANGELOG.md . Thanks to the great support of our community we have now 9 different languages available in total for the MASVS and would like to thank all of our translators for their great work and support throughout: Chinese (traditional) - Peter Chi, Lex Chien, Henry Hu and Leo Wang Chinese (simplified) - Bob Peng, Harold Zang and Jack S English - Jeroen Willemsen, Sven Schleier, Carlos Holguera and Jeroen Beckers French - Romuald Szkudlarek, Abderrahmane Aftahi and Christian Dong (Review) German - Rocco Gr\u00e4nitz and Sven Schleier Japanese - Koki Takeyama and Riotaro Okada (Review) Korean - Youngjae Jeon, Jeongwon Cho, Jiyou Han and Jiyeon Sung Russian - Eugen Martynov, Gall Maxim, Chelnokov Vladislav (Review), Oprya Egor (Review) and Tereshin Dmitry (Review) Spanish - Martin Marsicano and Carlos Holguera The MASVS and its translations are available in PDF, Mobile, ePub, docx and you can also read it via Gitbook. See here for details: https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs#getting-the-masvs The project team (Sven Schleier, Jeroen Willemsen and Carlos Holguera) would like to thank all the contributors, translators and those who build the improved automation around it and all their hard work and support in the last few months! New releases will be much faster thanks to our GitHub actions and Docker containers. Next to that, we are happy to add Korean and Chinese Simplified to our ever growing list of translations! We will finalize the document generation system and then apply the same build system to the Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) in order to speed up the release process and release more frequently. October 4th, 2019: Pre-release of MASVS 1.2! \u00b6 We have a pre-release of MASVS Version 1.2. This will be the reference document for further translations. October 2nd, 2019: MSTG Playground Release! \u00b6 Want more training apps? We hear you! We just released the MSTG-Android-Java & MSTG-Android-Kotlin for Android and the MSTG-JWT app for iOS.

August 4th, 2019: OSS Release! \u00b6 After a lot of work, we finally have a new release of the MSTG! Want to know more? Head over to the Github release page . August 2nd, 2019: Project promoted to Flagship status! \u00b6 We have been awarded Flagship status! We are very grateful and excited about this! We could not have done this without our team of awesome volunteers that have committed to the project, wrote issues, and supported us in many other ways. A special thanks goes out to OWASP and especially Harold Blankenship for facilitating us to function as a project and for leading the project review at OWASP Appsec Tel-Aviv! Thank you! June 5th, 2019: New release of the MASVS \u00b6 As the summit is progressing, so are we! We have just released a new version of the MASVS (1.1.4). Want to know more? Head over to the Github release page ! May 21nd, 2019: New release of the MSTG \u00b6 As part of the preparations for the Open Security Summit, we have released a new version of the MSTG. Want to know more? Head over to the Github release page ! May 7th, 2019: New release of the MSTG \u00b6 After many changes, we decided it was time to create a new release in order to improve the book version! Want to know more? Head over to the Github release page . April 15th, 2019: Book version, project promotion & preparation for the summit \u00b6 Given that most news is already shared via OWASP Slack over the last quarter, we still see that it is good to share a summary of all of the good things outside of Slack using this news section. In this update we have a lot to share! While we started off this year with an improved version of the MASVS and MSTG, things have not been quiet: there has been a huge development in master of the MSTG and many issues have been raised and fixed. In the meantime, we have worked on an actual print of the book! While an early version is available through Hulu (no link supplied, google and buy at your own risk), we are working on making a better version of that book. In the mean time we have filed for a project promotion to Flagship! Next a lot more cool things happened: with the now official publication of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-163 Revision 1 , the MASVS and MSTG are getting more mainstream ;-). The MASVS & MSTG are mentioned in various other upcoming programs/standards/recommendations as well, which is really a recognition of the hard work put in by the community. We are proud to be part of such a great project! Next, we are preparing to join the Open Security Summit again! Already three people will be on site, and at least one remote, but we would love to work with more people at the project again! Want to know more? Please get in touch via Slack and join the #project-mobile_omtg channel or follow us on Twitter . January 15th, 2019: Release of improved checklist \u00b6 We released a new version of the checklist! This version has adaptable references so that it can be used with newer versions of the MSTG as well. This version is currently available in French and English and we hope to add the Russian, Japanese, German and Spanish version soon! Want to know more? Take a look at our release page !. We would like to thank our volunteers for their effort to deliver these easy to use checklists! January 3rd, 2019: Multilanguage Release 1.1.2 of the MASVS \u00b6 We released the 1.1.2 version of the OWASP MASVS! This is the first version in Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish! Exactly: we just added French, German, Japanese and Chinese! Obviously this would not be possible without all the volunteers that helped us with translations, feedback, updating, and automating the release process! We are grateful for the awesome team that pulled this off! Want to see the result? Take a look at our release page ! November 39th, 2018: Release 1.1.0 of the MSTG \u00b6 We released the 1.1.0 version of the OWASP MSTG! Now all requirements of the MASVS have at least one covering testcase. We would like to thank all of our contributors for their hard work! Want to check it out? Check the releases !. October 28th, 2018: Call for Company references \u00b6 We are looking for company references that are using or have used the OWASP-MSTG and/or MASVS. If you have done so and are ok with being mentioned: please email to sven.schleier@owasp.org. October 28th, 2018: The MASVS is getting more translations \u00b6 Thanks to Romuald, Koki and many others, new translations of the MASVS are popping up. We now have a Japanese translation added and the French, German and Persian translations are in development. Each of them will be released the moment our release-automation of the MASVS is completed. Until then: feel free to checkout the sources! October 18th, 2018: The MSTG is now officially an OWASP Lab Project! \u00b6 During AppSec US 2018 in San Jose the Mobile Security Testing Guide was reviewed by several volunteers to assess the maturity of the project. As a result our request for project graduation to lab status was granted. The reviews can be found here . Thanks to Harold Blankenship for organising the project review event during AppSec US and for pushing things forward for all the OWASP projects and of course to all people that took the effort to review our project! October 13th, 2018: MSTG 1.0.2 released & Twitter account! \u00b6 While working hard towards the 1.1.0 milestone of the MSTG, we released the 1.0.2 version. From now onward we have better PDF, Epub and Mobi files! We hope to port this to the MASVS after the Github release. We now have an official Twitter account: @OWASP_MSTG ! September 21th, 2018: MASVS automation started \u00b6 Now that the document generation process for the MSTG has been optimized enough for milestone 1.1.0 (and we reached #1000 in Github of issues and Pull requests), we have started to improve the MASVS releasing mechanism. This will be further improved after Appsec USA and the release of 1.1.0 of the MSTG. September 16th, 2018: MSTG 1.0.1 released \u00b6 The Mobile Security Testing Guide version 1.0.1 has been released using our automated release system (based on tagging).

With these packages, we offer companies opportunities to create brand awareness and maximize visibility in the mobile security space. 100% of the funds raised go directly into the project budget and will be used to fund production of the final release. June 17th, 2017: The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide - Summit Preview \u00b6 The MSTG Summit Preview is an experimental proof-of-concept book created on the OWASP Summit 2017 in London. The goal was to improve the authoring process and book deployment pipeline, as well as to demonstrate the viability of the project. Note that the content is not final and will likely change significantly in subsequent releases. Download the ebook here . Mobile Security Testing Workshop on the OWASP Summit 2017 \u00b6 The OWASP MSTG team is organizing a 5-days mobile security track on the OWASP Summit 2017. The track consists of a series of book sprints, each of which focuses on producing content for a specific section in the OWASP MSTG, as well as proof-reading and editing the existing content. The goal is to make as much progress on the guide as is humanly possible. Depending on the number of participants, we\u2019ll split into sub-groups to work on different subsections or topic areas. How to Join \u00b6 Join up for the working session(s) you like by following the link(s) on the mobile security track page , then hitting the \"Edit this page here\" link at the bottom, and adding yourself to the \"participants\" field. Signing up is not mandatory, but helps us to better organize the sessions. Don\u2019t worry though if your session of choice happens on the \"wrong\" day - you can always simply stop by and we\u2019ll brief you on your topic of choice. After all, this is the Woodstock of appsec! Mobile security track main page: http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/ Mobile security track schedule: http://owaspsummit.org/schedule/tracks/Mobile-Security.html/ April 5th, 2017: Mobile App Security Verification Standard Update \u00b6 Version 0.9.3 of the MASVS is now available for download . This release contains several bug fixes and modifications to security requirements: * Merged requirements 7.8 and 7.9 into for simplification * Removed Anti-RE controls 8.1 and 8.2 * Updated MSTG links to current master * Section \"Environmental Interaction\" renamed to \"Platform Interaction\" * Removed To-dos * Fixed some wording & spelling issues January 31st, 2017: Mobile App Security Verification Standard v0.9.2 Available For Download \u00b6 The Mobile App Security Verification Standard (MASVS) has undergone a major revision, including a re-design of the security model and verification levels. We also revised many security requirements to address the multitude of issues raised on GitHub . The result is MASVS v0.9.2, which is now available for download in PDF format. As the MASVS is nearing maturity, we have decided to freeze the requirements until the Mobile Testing Guide and checklists \"catch up\" (due to the one-to-one mapping between requirements in the MASVS and MSTG, changes to the requirements make it necessary to update the other documents as well, causing repeated effort). Unless major issues pop up, the current list will therefore remain in place until MASVS/MSTG v1.0, and further changes will be reserved for v1.1 or later releases. The MASVS is a community effort to establish security requirements for designing, developing and testing secure mobile apps on iOS and Android.

January 28th, 2017: Mobile Crackmes and Reversing Tutorials \u00b6 A key goal of the OWASP Mobile Testing Project is to build the ultimate learning resource and reference guide for mobile app reversers. As hands-on hacking is by far the best way to learn, we'd like to link most of the content to practical examples. Starting now, we'll be adding crackmes for Android and iOS to the GitHub repo that will then be used as examples throughout the guide. The goal is to collect enough resources for demonstrating the most important tools and techniques in our guide, plus additional crackmes for practicing. For starters there are three challenges: Android License Validator Uncrackable App for iOS Level 1 Uncrackable App for iOS Level 2 One of these three already has a documented solution in the guide. Tutorials for solving the other two still need to be added . We Need More Authors and Contributors! \u00b6 Maybe you have noticed that the reverse engineering sections in the Mobile Testing Guide are incomplete . The reason: We're still in the starting stages and don't have a lot of authors and contributors (in fact, 99% of the reversing content was produced by one guy). We'd love to welcome you as a contributor of crackmes, tutorials, writeups, or simply new ideas for this project. What You Can Do \u00b6 The OWASP MSTG is an open project and there's a lot of flexibility - it mostly depends on your skill set and willingness to commit your time. That said, the some areas that need help are: Solving crackmes and contributing a tutorial to the guide (preferable a technique that's not already documented. Check the TOC first). Writing and adding new crackmes along with solutions (should also describe something not already in the guide. Cracking white-boxes, dynamic analysis using an emulator / introspection, etc. etc.). General reversing write-ups to describe specific processes and techniques Help us figure out r esiliency testing processes and obfuscation metrics The reversing part of the guide consists of the following chapters: Tampering and Reverse Engineering - General Overview Tampering and Reverse Engineering on Android Tampering and Reverse Engineering on iOS How To Join \u00b6 Read the author's guide first, and join the OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack Channel , where you'll find all the other project members. January 22nd, 2017: Mobile Testing Guide TOC Available \u00b6 As of now, we'll be auto-generating a table of contents out of the current MSTG master branch. This reflects the current state of the guide, and should make it easier to coordinate work between authors. A short-term goal is to finalize the structure of the guide so we get a clearer picture of what will be included in the final document. Lead authors are encouraged to complete the outline of their respective chapters. On another note, we still need additional authors to help with all sections of the guide, including mobile operating system overviews, testing processes and techniques, and reverse engineering. Especially iOS authors are in short supply! As usual, ping us on the Slack Channel if you want to contribute. December 4th, 2016: Call For Authors: The Ultimate Open-Source Mobile App Reverse Engineering Guide \u00b6 Reverse engineering is an art, and describing every available facet of it would fill a whole library. The sheer range techniques and possible specializations is mind-blowing: One can spend years working on a very specific, isolated sub-problem, such as automating malware analysis or developing novel de-obfuscation methods. For mobile app security testers, it can be challenging to filter through the vast amount of information and build a working methodology. Things become even more problematic when one is tasked to assess apps that are heavily obfuscated and have anti-tampering measures built in. One of the main goals in the MSTG is to build the ultimate resource for mobile reverse engineers. This includes not only basic static and dynamic analysis, but also advanced de-obfuscation, scripting and automation. Obviously, writing all this content is a lot of work, both in terms of general content and OS-specific how-tos. We're therefore looking for talented authors that want to join the project early on. Topics include the following: Basic Hybrid Static/Dynamic Analysis Code Injection and Dynamic Instrumentation (Substrate, FRIDA) Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (Valgrind, PIE) Analysis Frameworks (Metasm / Miasm) Symbolic Execution DCA and DPA attacks on white-box crypto Dynamic analysis frameworks (PANDA / DroidScope,...) Anything else we might have missed What is in for me? \u00b6 All of this is unpaid, volunteer work. However, depending on your contribution, you will be named in the \"lead authors\" or \"contributors\" list, and you'll be able to point to the fact that you co-authored the guide. You'll also be contributing to the field, helping others who are just starting out, and in turn becoming a happier person yourself (reaping the full benefits of your altruism). Where do I sign up? \u00b6 First of all, have a look at the existing RE chapters outline: Generic / Introduction Android iOS You'll probably immediately have ideas on how you can contribute. If that's the case, read the author's guide first. Then contact Bernhard Mueller - ideally directly on the OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack Channel, where you'll find all the other project members.

If your proposal qualifies for the MSTG/MASVS we'll convert it into an \"Issue\" (the discussion might take a while). \ud83c\udfaf Create Issues \u00b6 You can create Issues first for missing requirements, content or errors so that it can be discussed before creating a PR. In order to avoid conflicts that several people are working on the same issue without knowing it, the issue will be assigned to one or more people by the project leaders. Explain what you think is missing in the issue, including references (if available) and give a suggestion as to where it could be added. \ud83d\udcdd Open a Pull Request \u00b6 You can contribute with content or corrections by opening a Pull Request (PR). Your PR may be merged after review. Be sure to follow our style guide when writing content. Learn how to open a PR here . \u2705 Become a Reviewer \u00b6 You can Review Pull Requests (PRs) and also gain contributions. If you are a fluent speaker in any of the different languages that the MASVS is available in, feel free to give feedback on any of the submitted PRs. After your PR or issue has been submitted, we will review it as quickly as possible which typically only takes a few days.

Learn how to review a PR here . \ud83d\udd0e Proof-reading \u00b6 If you do proof-reading, these are the things we\u2019re looking for: Content cohesion & coherence is there a good linkage of ideas? does the paragraph make sense? does it make sense with the next one? think that hundreds of people have written in here, often without considering the surroundings of the text they were including). Reducing the content to a minimum (people tend to be very verbose/wordy) and in such a document we need clear and short/concise statements Optimize for scannability (maybe instead of a big paragraph it would be better to have a bullet point list). Any passive voice sentences? Convert to active voice. Does each paragraph focus on a single topic? Are key points stated at the start of each section?

After the first translation is done, we will ask for your help to translate any new changes, so your translation can remain up to date. We need a second translator who can verify that the English version of the MASVS has been translated properly.

Commercial tools are typically not accepted, but might be referenced in some specific cases.

Avoid duplicating other sections of the guide; Refrain from advertising commercial tools or services; When giving technical instructions, address the reader in the second person. 1. How to Write Content \u00b6 Amount of Content \u00b6 The primary measure for amount of content on a page should be based on the purpose it serves. Use short pages Those containing one or two screens of text at most. Users are scanning for link choices. Use longer pages (those that require more scrolling or reading) deeper within the chapter where content can be printed and read later. For very large sections of information Consider creating a supporting document and linking to it from the page rather than displaying all the information directly on the page. Gender Neutrality \u00b6 The MSTG reaches all kind of people all over the world. To ensure inclusiveness and diversity, please refrain from using the following throughout the book: she / her / hers / herself he / him / his / himself Or any other constructions like \"he/she\", \"s/he\", \"his or her\". Instead, use the following gender-neutral alternatives: Omit the pronoun if possible: \"The user authenticates himself using ...\" -> \"The user authenticates using ...\" Replace pronouns with \"the or \"a\": \"When the user enters his password ...\" -> \"When the user enters the password ...\" Use plural nouns and pronouns: \"An attacker will use his jailbroken device ...\" -> \"Attackers will use their jailbroken devices ...\" Use the second person: \"If the attacker runs this code, he can bypass ...\" -> \"If you run this code, you can bypass ...\" Use the imperative: \"A developer should never use ... in his code\" -> \"Never use ... in your code!\" There is one exception: We are still using \"man in the middle\", as it is simply a common term in the industry and there is no common replacement for it. Timeliness of Content \u00b6 Keeping accurate and timely content establishes the 'Mobile Security Testing Guide' as a credible and trustworthy source of information. When using statistical data on your page, ensure that the information is current and up-to-date and is accompanied by the source from which it was derived, along with the date the data was compiled. Content for the Digital Platform Versus for Print \u00b6 Write concise content that the user can read quickly and efficiently. For digital content - create shorter pages that are cross-linked. If your content is likely to be printed, create one long page. Audience \u00b6 Write for an international audience with a basic level of technical understanding i.e. they have a mobile phone and know how to install an app. Avoid hard-to-translate slang words/phrases to ensure content is accessible to readers who aren't native English speakers. Context and Orientation \u00b6 Let the users know where they are on every page. Establish the topic by using a unique page heading. Include a clear and concise introduction where possible. Link to background information where necessary. Write so People Will Read with Joy \u00b6 Use the following methods to increase scannability: Use left alignment for headings, subheadings, and text Link where appropriate Use lists rather than paragraphs wherever possible Use dashes - rather than asterisks * for lists Include only one main idea in each paragraph Put the most important information at the top Start the page with the conclusion as well as a short summary of the remaining content Use headings where applicable Use short, simple words that are to the point Be concise and focused For longer pages, use the following tools to make the page easily scannable: Anchor links Subheadings and relevant links Bulleted copy Meaningful graphics, or pull quotes, to break up larger blocks of text End links Effective Use of Lists \u00b6 When presenting your content in a list format: Use numbered lists when the order of entries is important. Use bulleted lists whenever the order of the entries is not important. Generally, limit the number of items in a single list to no more than nine. Generally, limit lists to no more than two levels: primary and secondary. Punctuate and capitalize list items consistently (CMOS 6.124-6.126). Don't add end punctuation to list items that are not complete sentences unless they complete the sentence that introduces the list. Use appropriate capitalization and end punctuation for list items that individually form complete sentences. If the list items complete an introductory sentence, end each (except the last item) with a comma and do not add \"and\" after the second-to-last item. End the last item with appropriate end punctuation (usu. a period). Numbering Conventions \u00b6 When using a number between zero and ten, spell out the number (e.g., \"three\" or \"ten\"). When using any number higher than ten, use the numeric version (e.g., \"12\" or \"300\"). 2. Language \u00b6 American Spelling and Terminology \u00b6 Use American spelling and terminology. Change all British spelling and terminology to the American equivalents where applicable. This includes \"toward\" (US) vs. \"towards\" (UK), \"among\" (US) vs. \"amongst\" (UK), \"analyze\" (US) vs. \"analyse\" (UK), \"behavior\" (US) vs \"behaviour\" (UK), etc. Plurals \u00b6 Adhere to standard grammar and punctuation rules when it comes to pluralization of typical words. The plural of calendar years does not take the apostrophe before the \"s\". For example, the plural form of 1990 is 1990s. Title Capitalization \u00b6 We follow the title case rules from the \"Chicago Manual of Style\": Capitalize the first and last word in a title, regardless of part of speech Capitalize all nouns (app, encryption, package), pronouns (you, she, it), verbs (analyze, compile, inspect), adjectives (active, insecure, weak), adverbs (immediately, quietly), and subordinating conjunctions (as, because, although) Lowercase \"to\" as part of an infinitive Lowercase all articles (a, the), prepositions (to, at, in, with), and coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or) When in doubt, you can verify proper capitalization on https://titlecaseconverter.com/ . Standardization \u00b6 This is a list of words/abbreviations that are used inconsistently at the moment in the MSTG and need standardization: man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) Contractions \u00b6 Use the following common contractions: are not -> aren't cannot -> can't could not -> couldn't did not -> didn't do not -> don't does not -> doesn't has not -> hasn't had not -> hadn't have not -> haven't is not -> isn't it is -> it's that is -> that's there is -> there's was not -> wasn't were not -> weren't will not -> won't would not -> wouldn't you are -> you're you have + verb -> you've + verb you will -> you'll Abbreviations \u00b6 Abbreviations include acronyms, initialisms, shortened words, and contractions. Spell out the term the first time it's used, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Example: Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). Subsequent usages in the same chapter may include the abbreviation only. If it only appears once in the content, spell out the term instead of using the abbreviation. In titles and headings, use the abbreviation but be sure to properly introduce it (see above) in the text that follows. Use \"a\" or \"an\" depending on the pronunciation of the acronym. Example: a DLL, an APK, a URL, a SQL. Add an \"s\" for the plural form unless the abbreviation already stands for a plural noun. Example: the APIs, CSS (not CSSs). If the abbreviation is better known as its full spelled-out term, use only the abbreviation. Example: PDF, URL, USB, ZIP. The following snippet demonstrates most of these points: ## JAR Files JAR (Java ARchive) files are [...] APKs are packed using the ZIP format. An APK is a variation of a JAR file [...] For commonly used file formats such as APK, IPA or ZIP, please do not refer to them as \".apk\", \".ipa\" or \".zip\" unless you're explicitly referring to the file extension. Referencing Android versions \u00b6 Use the following format when referring to an Android version: Android X (API level YY). Usage of the descriptive name (Ex: Oreo) is discouraged. Ex: Android 9 (API level 28) Addressing the Reader in Test Cases \u00b6 Throughout the guide, you may want to address the readers in order to tell them what to do, or what they should notice. For any such case, use an active approach and simply address the reader using \"you\". Correct: If you open the AndroidManifest.xml file, you will see a main Application tag, with the following attributes: atr1, atr2 and atr3. If you run the following command, you will see that atr1 is actually dangerous: [...]. Wrong: The AndroidManifest.xml file contains an Application tag, with the following attributes: atr1, atr2 and atr3. The command below shows that atr1 is dangerous: [...]. Wrong: If we open the AndroidManifest.xml file, we will see a main Application tag, with the following attributes: atr1, atr2 and atr3. If we run the following command, we will see that atr1 is actually dangerous: [...]. 3. External References \u00b6 Web Links \u00b6 Use markdown's in-line link format (A) [TEXT](URL \"TITLE\") or (B) [TEXT](URL) . For example: The [ threat modeling guidelines defined by OWASP ]( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling \"OWASP Application Threat Modeling\" ) are generally applicable to mobile apps. When using (A), be sure to escape special characters such as apostrophe (\\') or single quote (`), as otherwise the link will be broken in Gitbook. Wrong usage, see \"iPhone's\": [ UDID of your iOS device via iTunes ]( https://medium.com/@igor_marques/how-to-find-an-iphones-udid-2d157f1cf2b9 \"How to Find Your iPhone's UDID\" ) Right usage, see \"iPhone\\'s\": [ UDID of your iOS device via iTunes ]( https://medium.com/@igor_marques/how-to-find-an-iphones-udid-2d157f1cf2b9 \"How to Find Your iPhone\\'s UDID\" ) When adding links to the \"References\" section at the end of the chapters use - Title - <url> , for example: - adb - <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb> Books and Papers \u00b6 For books and papers, use the following format: [#NAME] . And include the full reference in the \"References\" section at the end of the markdown file manually. Example: An obfuscated encryption algorithm can generate its key (or part of the key) using data collected from the environment [#riordan]. And under the \"References\" section at the end of the chapters: - [#riordan] - James Riordan, Bruce Schneier. Environmental Key Generation towards Clueless Agents. Mobile Agents and Security, Springer Verlag, 1998 Papers: The general form for citing technical reports is to place the name and location of the company or institution after the author and title and to give the report number and date at the end of the reference. Basic Format: - [shortname] J. K. Author, \"Title of report,\" Abbrev. Name of Co., City of Co., Abbrev. State, Rep. xxx, year - [shortname] \\[Author(s)\\], \\[Title\\] - Link Books: - [shortname] \\[Author(s)\\], \\[Title\\], \\[Published\\], \\[Year\\] - [examplebook] J. K. Author, \"Title of chapter in the book,\" in Title of His Published Book, xth ed. City of Publisher, Country if not USA: Abbrev. of Publisher, year, ch. x, sec. x, pp. xxx-xxx. NOTE: Use et al. when three or more names are given e.g. - [klaus] B. Klaus and P. Horn, Robot Vision. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1986. - [stein] L. Stein, \"Random patterns,\" in Computers and You, J. S. Brake, Ed. New York: Wiley, 1994, pp. 55-70. - [myer] R. L. Myer, \"Parametric oscillators and nonlinear materials,\" in Nonlinear Optics, vol. 4, P. G. Harper and B. S. Wherret, Eds. San Francisco, CA: Academic, 1977, pp. 47-160. - [abramowitz] M. Abramowitz and I. A. Stegun, Eds., Handbook of Mathematical Functions (Applied Mathematics Series 55). Washington, DC: NBS, 1964, pp. 32-33. 4. References Within The Guide \u00b6 For references to other chapters in the MSTG, simply name the chapter, e.g.: See also the chapter \"Basic Security Testing\" , See the section \"Apktool\" in the chapter \"Basic Security Testing\" etc. The MSTG should be convenient to read as a printed book, so use internal references sparingly. Alternatively you can create a link for the specific section: See the section \"[App Bundles](0x05a-Platform-Overview.md#app-bundles)\" in the chapter ... Note that in such a case the anchor (everything after the # ) should be lowercase, and spaces should be replaced with hyphens. 5. Insert Pictures \u00b6 Pictures should be uploaded to the Images/Chapters directory. Afterwards they should be embedded by using the image tag, a width of 500px should be specified. For example: <img src=\"Images/Chapters/0x06d/key_hierarchy_apple.jpg\" width=\"500px\"/> - *iOS Data Protection Key Hierarchy* 6. Punctuation Conventions \u00b6 Lowercase or Capital Letter after a Colon \u00b6 Chicago Manual of Style (6.61: Lowercase or capital letter after a colon) says: lowercase the first word unless it is a proper noun or the start of at least two complete sentences or a direct question. Serial Comma Use \u00b6 Use a serial comma before \"and\" for the last item in a run-in list of three or more items. For example: We bought apples, oranges, and tomatoes from the store. Quote Marks and Apostrophes \u00b6 Use straight double quotes, straight single quotes, and straight apostrophes (not curly quotes/apostrophes). Technical Terms \u00b6 Spell/punctuate specific technical terms as they are used by the company (e.g., use the company website). In order of preference, spell/punctuate generic technical terms according to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th edition. Microsoft Manual of Style, 4th edition foldoc.org (Free Online Dictionary of Computing) Noun Form Adjectival Form App Store NA backend backend Base64 Base64- black box same Bundle ID NA bytecode NA client side client-side codebase same code signing same command line same disassembler NA end users NA file name same macOS NA OS X NA pentest same PhoneGap NA Python NA repackage NA runtime same server side server-side snapshot length NA use case same Wi-Fi same white box same 7. Comments \u00b6 Markdown blockquotes can be used for comments in the documents by using > > This is a blockquote 8. Code and Shell Commands \u00b6 Use code blocks when including sample code, shell commands, and paths. In Markdown, code blocks are denoted by triple backticks ( ``` ). GitHub also supports syntax highlighting for a variety of languages. For example, a Java code block should be annotated as follows: ```java public static void main ( String [] args ) { System . out . println ( \" Hello World!\" ); } } ; ``` This produces the following result: public static void main ( String [] args ) { System . out . println ( \" Hello World!\" ); } } When including shell commands, make sure to the language for correct syntax highlighting (e.g. shell or bash ) and remove any host names and usernames from the command prompt, e.g.: ```shell $ echo 'Hello World' Hello World ``` When a command requires parameters that need to be modified by the reader, surround them with angle brackets: $ adb pull <remote_file> <target_destination> In-text Keywords \u00b6 When they do not occur in a code block, place the following code-related keywords in backticks ( `` ), double straight quote marks ( \"\" ), or leave unpunctuated according to the table: Backticks Quotation Marks No Punctuation function names section titles application name method names chapter titles folder names commands book titles memory addresses (e.g. 0x100044520) class names flags values (e.g., \"true\", lowercase) block names command options (e.g., \"help\" option) flag names single menu item (e.g., \"Home\" menu) file names system error msgs. package names file paths passwords port numbers binary names method/function arguments method/function argument or return values (e.g., true , 0 , YES ) XML attributes (e.g., get-task-allow on iOS Plists, \"@string/app_name\" on Android Manifests) XML attribute values (e.g., android:label on Android Manifests) property names object names API calls interface names If nouns in backticks are plural, place the \"s\" after the second backtick (e.g. RuntimeException s). Do not add parentheses, brackets, or other punctuation to any keywords that are in backticks (e.g., main not main() ). Navigation \u00b6 When referring to any UI element by name, put its name in boldface, using **<name>** (e.g., Home -> Menu ).","title":"Style Guide"},{"location":"contributing/5_Style_Guide/#style-guide","text":"The following rules are meant to ensure consistency of the MSTG: Keep the content factual, brief and focused.

In Markdown, code blocks are denoted by triple backticks ( ``` ). GitHub also supports syntax highlighting for a variety of languages. For example, a Java code block should be annotated as follows: ```java public static void main ( String [] args ) { System . out . println ( \" Hello World!\" ); } } ; ``` This produces the following result: public static void main ( String [] args ) { System . out . println ( \" Hello World!\" ); } } When including shell commands, make sure to the language for correct syntax highlighting (e.g. shell or bash ) and remove any host names and usernames from the command prompt, e.g.: ```shell $ echo 'Hello World' Hello World ``` When a command requires parameters that need to be modified by the reader, surround them with angle brackets: $ adb pull <remote_file> <target_destination>","title":"8.
